# are $compilation_dir and $interpreter really a good idea ?
# more robust/dry in case the places where they are changed in the future,
# but also means that I can't easily use use the present makefile locally manually.
# A fix to that would be to add generated symbolic links in the level as well during levle/save creation,
# but if I go that road, I might as well link target/vns_game.sh
# TODO: the best solution for $interpreter is to add target to PATH, even if momentarilly so.
# For $compilation_dir, this is fine, I now copy the asm definition in the save, which is at a constant path relative to individual levels.

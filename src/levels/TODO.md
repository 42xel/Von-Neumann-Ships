TODO:

    return error for errored make and make tests even
when already tested
    test cases generation rather than static i/o
    levels/common + symlinks rather than duplication
	make instructions, rather than copy paste them.
	use makeifile and check to fill in sections
	Goals, test g√©neration.

    other typologie/naming scheme ?
problem variants ?
o: hackable or clean
l: only clean
i: anything goes

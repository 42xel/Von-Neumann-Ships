# Engine Design

ternary system with 81 size addressable space ?

oxxxx : own/program
ixxxx : input
lxxxx : output

registers:
- prg : the program head. Initially ooooo,
    meaning the starting instruction is the value at ooooo (*prg).
- stk : the stack head. Initially oiiii.
- aux : an auxiliary register. Initially ollll.
    It is also used for indirections, and io.

- file descriptor ? not readily present on the memory but accessible,
    much like register addreses.
    (including special io, everything is a file)

# Instruction set
Unstable and unfinished. For now, see src/interpreter/opcode.h and src/interpreter/interpreter.c .

Between 0 and 2 trits are used to describe an operand, depending on the operation.
The operation takes up the rest, 2 to 5 trits, provided at most 3 trits are used for operands (1 + 2).

short operand description, usually :
stk[0], prg[0/1], *aux

long operand description, usually :
pop (stk[-1]), emplace (stk[0]), push (stk[1]),
prg, prg[0], prg[1],
aux, *aux, **aux
self-relative indirections ?

## Instructions set

### long short (* 27)
? swap

## short short (* 9)

### stk *6

pop

## long (* 9)
immediate load (prg[1])

## short (* 3)
get_reg_addr
set_reg_addr # In theory, can be emulated with a combination of get_reg_addr, store, and immediate load
indirection: *aux = **aux, *aux = *prg[1] et stk[0] = **aux

### fixed operand (* 1) : *stk <- opn *aux *stk
? xor
? addmod
? minus
? neg # would spare a constant and an operation
      # compared to xor lllll, but it might be
      # an intentional constraints to push people
      # to be smart about something simple,
      # keeping lllll around closeby for bulk negation
(prg[1] ?)
sieve
orUnsieve
? split
shake/permut

fork
inspect (prg[1])
? 0: halt # could be EoF
? wait # one of the other operation surely is wait
? noop # one of the other operation surely is noop.

? reset registers ?
? launch w default reg ?

## machine code
    Becuase of high reflexivity (VN arch) but low level, the exact
choice of machine code values matters a lot. Ideally, good groupings
should allow for easy manipulation of code using tritwise operations.
In practice, there is also the constraint that we aren't rich in
opcode space.
    The temporary solution is to leave the instruction set up to
debate, and to let advanced players configure (map) their own machine
code (and to use them as inspiration for sensible defaults).

# assembly
For now, relying heavily on customasm

- Possibility to anchor the code, to start from anywhere
instead of oiiii.
Syntaxe: like a label but name is a number.
- possibility to enter raw machine code.

## examples
### add5: *liiii = *illll + 5
oiiii: 5
0:
stk |+> -&stk // stk |+> *(--&stk) where the actual variable is &stk, and stk is short for *&stk.
&aux <> &stk
aux |> +&stk // aux |> *(++&stk)


### copy serial: for x in liiii .. lllll, *x = *-x
0:


# CLI design

Several executables, not too much, but maybe just enough.

## vns
    the interpreter and maybe compiler (for now, it's customasm)
## ???
    maybe a compiler/transpiler
(maybe a set a transpiler and a single command to rule them all)

    TODO Savefiles manipulations
        option to prune empty level directories ?
        to fill them (unlock all/some levels) ? or to fill some ? isn't fill just --no-check --no-time --no-run ? Nah, that is just printing the last dir

# levels

## level ideas

### classical problems
- arithmetics (ideas written in reversed polish `.` is input):
    - .3+
    - ....+*-
    - prime
    - foobar
    - syracuse
    - long integers
- something something lookup table ?
    - mapping
- copy
    - copy just 2
    - reversed copy
    - append
- range
    - reversed
    - repeat
- delete
    - peek and shift
    - seek, delete and shift
- search
    - prefix
    - suffix
    - sub-pattern
    - sub-sequence
- vector operation
    - arithmetics
    - clamping
- 'crypto'
    - cyphper

### less classical problems
- quine(s)

Problems consisting of an input and a flux.
For example, solving mapping with indirect jump.

### interactive problems
step, pause, vcs/git
realtime ?
console ?
editor ?

### multi something

## completion
input unchanged (no cheating)
input never changed (read only)
never read from outut (write only)
    (*2 ? never used from ouput as rhs
    and never moved info out from output)

? prg constant (reusability)

## score

# User Interface
On the launching screen, have something like EXAPUNKS, whith keywords popping and fading in the backgrounds.

Ideally, they should be fragments of the codes running the game within the game.
Because that's currently impossible, they should be sampled at random among .not_sol and the savegames.
